# About
- A simple webiste/server that mines data from other websites, intakes past numbers about library entrance from the past and makes prediction about how full a library is. I started this project to learn flask and did not get time to complete it since!
- Currently not a lot or any css/js implemented.
- Data is inaccurate, needs to be fixed.
